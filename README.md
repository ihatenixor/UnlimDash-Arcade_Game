# UnlimDash-Arcade_Game
Little endless arcade game on python
In this game your goal is just to let the white ball pass by black ones
I found one bug in this game. If u will spam clicks black balls will stay in one place(not at all, they will move but not in such big distance)
Also your highscore from your last session will be saved in record.csv
But one - in this game is if you restart your game session it will reset your highscore to 0, but CSV file will save it.
Have fun with this peace of game XD.
